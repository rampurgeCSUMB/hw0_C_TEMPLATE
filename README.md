This is an exercise. There’s no actual credit for the homework 0. However, do your best to get the basic idea of how a homework assignment is downloaded, edited, submitted, and tested in CST370.

Read the homework description carefully before starting it.

How to turn in:

After pushing the final version to Github, hit the "Actions" tab. <br>
Select "Github classroom flow" on the left side. <br>
Then hit "Run workflow". <br>
Due time is 11:55(PM). Since there could be a long delay between your computer and Github classroom workflow, you should submit it early. <br>
When you submit your homework program, don’t forget to include "Title", "Abstract", "Name", and "Date". <br>
